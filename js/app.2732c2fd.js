This is indicative of his philosophical beliefs, which focus on more abstract ideas and that reality exists in the “realm” of the spiritual world. This is compared to Aristotle’s gesture beside him, which gestures to the earth below, indicative of his beliefs that reality is in the physical form.

Few artists had ever depicted the scene as dramatically as Michelangelo, and even in our secular age, it has made it virtually metonymic for the entire story of Genesis in contemporary culture. It is so often invoked, cited, or riffed on for its religious meaning that it may actually be possible to forget just what a terrific act of artistic theater it is. </p><br><p> The creation of Adam has several figures in it. The Main figures being God and Adam.Art historians speculate that Eve has also been featured in this painting. The figure by God’s left hand is believed to be Eve. That is the only feminine figure in the fresco. Adam is also portrayed to have an extra rib. This is believed to represent Eve too. Adam, located on the left side, is painted in a somewhat relaxed fashion. His figure appears to be responding to the imminent touch of God – this is where the title comes in. Adam is receiving life directly from the source, and through the life given to him – he will, in turn, give life to all of humanity.
